Capstone
-------------

Capstone is a disassembly library required for gathering ROP gadgets
and ROP chain generation.

It's a separate requirement from ``binutils`` because it's used by
Jon Salwan's ``ROPgadget`` tool which we use under the covers.

In particular, version ``2.1.2`` should be used.  Capstone can be downloaded here_, or installed with the steps below.
